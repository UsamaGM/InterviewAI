Project Title: InterviewAI

Technology Stack:

    Frontend:

        React (with functional components and hooks)

        Redux (for global state management)

        React Router (for navigation)

        Axios (for API requests)

        Material-UI or Ant Design (for UI components - choose one)

        Date-fns or Moment.js (for date/time handling)

        react-beautiful-dnd (optional, for drag-and-drop question ordering if desired)

    Backend:

        Node.js

        Express.js

        MongoDB (with Mongoose for object modeling)

        JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication

        Nodemailer (for sending emails)

        OpenAI API (or a similar large language model API)

        Multer (for file uploads, if you allow uploading resumes)

    AI Integration:

        OpenAI API (or a similar powerful LLM) - This is the core for question generation, answer assessment, and scoring. You'll need to carefully craft prompts to get the desired results.

    Deployment:

        Heroku, Netlify, AWS, or similar platforms.

Detailed Feature Breakdown:

    Interview Creation and Management:

        Frontend:

            A form for recruiters to create interviews (title, description, job role).

            A list view of existing interviews, with filtering and sorting options.

            An edit view to modify interview details.

            Ability to add/remove/reorder questions (potentially with drag-and-drop).

        Backend:

            CRUD operations for the Interview model.

            Middleware to ensure only recruiters can create/edit/delete interviews.

            Logic to handle question generation (see AI section below).

    User Creation and Management:

        Frontend:

            Registration and login forms.

            User profile pages.

            Admin panel for user management (if you have an admin role).

        Backend:

            User registration with email verification (using Nodemailer and a unique token).

            User login with JWT authentication.

            Password reset functionality.

            CRUD operations for the User model.

            Middleware for role-based access control (e.g., only admins can delete users).

    Ability to Schedule Interviews for Future:

        Frontend:

            A date/time picker in the interview creation/edit form.

            Display of scheduled time on interview details.

        Backend:

            Store the scheduledTime in the Interview model.

            A scheduled task (using a library like node-cron or a database-backed queue like Bull) to send reminder emails before the interview starts.

    Emails for Verification and Reminders:

        Backend:

            Use Nodemailer to send emails:

                Verification: After registration, send an email with a verification link containing a unique token.

                Reminders: Use node-cron (or similar) to schedule email sending before the scheduledTime.

                Password Reset: Send emails with reset tokens for forgotten passwords.

            Create email templates (using a templating engine like EJS or Handlebars, or just plain HTML).

    AI that Generates Interview Questions, Assesses Answers, and Rates the Interview:

        Backend (aiService.js):

            Question Generation:

                generateQuestions(jobRole, interviewDescription):

                    Construct a prompt for the OpenAI API. Example prompt: "Generate 5 interview questions for a [jobRole] position, focusing on [interviewDescription]. Format the questions as a JSON array: [{ "question": "..." }, { "question": "..." }, ...]". Be very specific in your prompt!

                    Call the OpenAI API.

                    Parse the response (which should be JSON) and save the questions to the Interview model.

            Answer Assessment:

                assessAnswer(questionText, answerText, jobRole):

                    Construct a prompt for the OpenAI API. Example prompt: "Assess the following answer to the interview question: '[questionText]'. Answer: '[answerText]'. The job role is [jobRole]. Provide a score (0-10), a list of relevant keywords, a sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral), and brief feedback. Format the response as JSON: {"score": ..., "keywords": [...], "sentiment": "...", "feedback": "..."}".

                    Call the OpenAI API.

                    Parse the response and save the aiAssessment to the Question object.

            Overall Interview Rating:

                rateInterview(interviewId):

                    Retrieve the interview and all its questions with their aiAssessment.

                    Calculate an overall score (e.g., average of question scores).

                    Generate overall feedback (you could use OpenAI for this too, summarizing the individual assessments).

                    Update the Interview model with the score and feedback.

        Frontend:

            Display the generated questions to the candidate.

            Provide input fields for answers.

            Display the AI assessment and overall rating to the recruiter (after the interview is completed).

Key Considerations and Best Practices:

    Error Handling: Implement robust error handling throughout the application (try-catch blocks, error middleware in Express).

    Security:

        Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and other vulnerabilities.

        Use HTTPS.

        Store passwords securely (using bcrypt).

        Protect API keys and other sensitive information using environment variables.

        Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

    Scalability: Design your database schema and API to handle a large number of users and interviews.

    Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure your code works correctly.

    User Experience:

        Provide clear instructions and feedback to users.

        Make the interface intuitive and easy to use.

        Design for responsiveness (mobile-friendly).

    OpenAI API Usage:

        Monitor your API usage and costs.

        Implement error handling for API calls (e.g., rate limits, network errors).

        Consider caching API responses (with appropriate invalidation) to improve performance and reduce costs.

    Asynchronous Operations: Handle Promises and async/await properly, especially with database operations and API calls.

Development Steps:

    Set up the Project:

        Create the project directory structure.

        Initialize Node.js projects for both client and server (npm init -y).

        Install necessary dependencies in both client and server.

    Backend - Authentication:

        Create the User model.

        Implement registration, login, and email verification routes.

        Set up JWT authentication middleware.

    Backend - Interview and User Models:

        Create the Interview model.

        Implement basic CRUD routes for interviews and users (without AI integration yet).

    Frontend - Basic UI:

        Create basic React components for login, registration, dashboard, and interview listing.

        Connect the frontend to the backend API.

    Backend - AI Integration:

        Create the aiService.js file.

        Implement the generateQuestions, assessAnswer, and rateInterview functions.

        Integrate these functions into the interview routes.

    Frontend - AI Features:

        Update the interview components to display generated questions and AI assessments.

        Add input fields for candidate answers.

    Backend - Scheduling and Emails:

        Implement the scheduling logic using node-cron (or similar).

        Set up email sending using Nodemailer.

    Frontend - Scheduling:

        Add a date/time picker to the interview form.

    Testing and Refinement:

        Write tests for your API endpoints and frontend components.

        Refactor your code for better organization and performance.

        Thoroughly test the AI integration and adjust prompts as needed.

    Deployment:

        Deploy the frontend and backend to your chosen hosting platforms.
